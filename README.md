## Notes to future self

### Easily-forgotten dependencies

Besides usual dependencies like `git`, `vim`, and `zsh`, you need the following
things.

### Manage multiple configuration files in a single repository

Previously, I have tried to separate this repository into multiple submodules,
but it was troublesome to manage them. When I had to modify a configuration, I
had to make a commit in both the main and submodule repositories. It is better
to keep everything in a single repository and manage them as separate files.
This way, I can easily modify and commit changes without worrying about the
submodules.
