## Notes to future self

### Store in single file, not multiple files

Configuration files like `.vimrc` should be created as a single file rather
than split into multiple files. I tried dividing my `.vimrc` into several
sub-files, but it became cumbersome to locate and edit the specific sub-file
needed. Even with shortcuts to open `.vimrc`, the actual edits were required in
the sub-files, which was frustrating. Configuration files should be easy to
edit and immediately effective. Although consolidating everything into one file
can make it lengthy and challenging to edit, using features like folding
settings, it is still better to keep everything in a single file.
